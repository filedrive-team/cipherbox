Keep data private on public distributed storage like Filecoin/IPFS

###Motivation

Data saved on a single device may be lost for various reasons, such as improper operation, hardware failures, and natural disasters. One of the main methods to protect important data is backup. The widely used decentralized storage networks, such as IPFS & Filecoin, is ideal for data backup. It currently hosts large amount of open public data. Bear in mind that private data should be encryted before put it to public networks.  But the whole process that users facing would be daunting. CipherBox aim to ease the backup process and help users mange backup tasks in a relaxed and enjoyed way.
